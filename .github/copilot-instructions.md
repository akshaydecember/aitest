# Copilot Instructions

This document provides essential guidance for AI coding agents working in this codebase.

## Project Status

This is a new project with an empty workspace. As the codebase develops, these instructions should be updated to reflect:
- Architecture decisions and component relationships
- Development workflows and build processes
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Integration points and external dependencies

## Getting Started

### Project Setup
- *To be documented as project structure is established*

### Build & Development
- *To be documented as build processes are defined*

### Testing
- *To be documented as testing infrastructure is set up*

## Architecture Overview

*To be documented once major components and modules are created*

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Code Style
- *To be documented as coding standards are established*

### File Organization
- *To be documented as directory structure is finalized*

### Component Communication
- *To be documented as inter-component patterns emerge*

## Important Workflows

### Development Cycle
- *To be documented with actual commands and processes*

### Common Tasks
- *To be documented with project-specific approaches*

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- *To be documented as external services/libraries are integrated*

### API/Service Boundaries
- *To be documented when services are defined*

## Next Steps

1. Create initial project structure and document in `Architecture Overview`
2. Define build and test commands in `Build & Development`
3. Document coding patterns in `Key Patterns & Conventions`
4. Add specific examples and file references once codebase grows
